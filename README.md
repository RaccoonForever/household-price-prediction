# household-price-prediction

This notebook is my answer to "Aurelien Geron - Hands On Machine Learning 2" exercise for an end to end machine learning project example.

To make this work, you juste need to have a virtual environment with dependencies (specified in requirements.txt)

This exercise was about a household price prediction on US West Coast. Using some simple regressor such as Tree, Forest, SVM classifiers.

The goal was to understand the functionning of scikit + numpy + pandas and moreover to make a full pipeline from scratch with data preparation, feature selection and prediction.
Of course I could have been deeper, but the goal was not to have the perfect model.
